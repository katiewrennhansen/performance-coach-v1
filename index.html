            <p>Alex Jones has emerged as one of the ideal performance coaches of the present time. His background begins with a walk-on opportunity for football and track and field at Gardner-Webb University as well as North Carolina Central University.  The result was three conference champions and a post-season birth in football. “The interest began there when I recognized that there was not only talent but proper training principles that I authored and performed well”, he states.  The interest then continued as he engaged with Olympic Track runners at St. Augustine’s University, while helping with the strength program for football as well.  An opportunity arose for arena football and was declined as the passion to properly teach and coach athletes strong-armed the individual chance.  The initiative would be followed with great pursuit as an opportunity to birth a strength program for a football team and coach would arise.  The results lead to a Head Track and Field Coach position which resulted in 18 athletes qualifying for regionals and 12 qualifying for the state championships.  The ensuing opportunity landed him as Director of Strength and Conditioning collegiately where professionals have resulted in the sports of football, softball, and basketball. The dream will continue as he spreads his knowledge to the younger athletes of today.  “If they are properly taught and trained early, it will elevate their chances of success anywhere athletically. “</p>
